# PakExplorer

PakExplorer is a simple Quake `.pak` archive viewer inspired by PakScape and originally developed by Peter Engström. It renders the PAK directory tree, lets you add/remove files, and export modified archives.

## Building

Use Xcode (macOS) to open `PakExplorer.xcodeproj` and build the project. There is also a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) that compiles the app on `macos-latest` and uploads a release artifact.

## License

The project follows the same licenses as the original tools it is based on.
